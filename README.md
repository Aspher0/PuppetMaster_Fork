# PuppetMaster Fork

This fork is intended to add a few features the original plugin is missing.
Those features include :
- Being able to enable or disabled the plugin with a checkbox
- Being able to enable a whitelist and a blacklist (And organize entries to those lists with dragging and dropping)
- Being able to add specific settings per whitelisted players or to make them use the default settings

Dev Changelog :
- Preparation for Dalamud API level 10 (IPlugginLogger)
- Cleaned decompiled code

# How to Use

Just put that custom repo inside of Dalamud settings : `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Aspher0/PuppetMaster_Fork/main/PuppetMaster.json`
