# PuppetMaster Fork

This fork is intended to add a few features the original plugin is missing.
Those features include :
- Being able to enable or disabled the plugin with a checkbox
- Being able to enable a whitelist and a blacklist
- Being able to add specific settings per whitelisted players or to make them use the default settings

Thanks to DodingDaga for this awesome plugin.
